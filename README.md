## DOWNLOADING DATASETS
The code contained in '/swell' and '/wesad' expect folders called '/classification' in order to run experiments.
Due to large file sizes, it is impossible to provide the files within these folders on github. Instead, we suggest you follow this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qiriro/stress

Once downloaded, navigate to:
2. Final --> datasets --> hrv --> swell/wesad --> combined --> classification

The files that the scripts are expecting will be there. Whoop data is included.
